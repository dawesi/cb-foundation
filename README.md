cb-foundation
============

This is a simple ContentBox layout based on Zurb's foundation responsive framework
It's easy to use and include 3 cutoms widgets :
- OrbitSlider => A responsive slider wich accepts images or HTML as content to display in slides
- JqueryTwiter => A basic jQueryPlugin to render a twitter timeline
- AssetMananger => A simple helper to manage CSS/JS assets and output
- RecentEntries => An adaptation of the widget included in ContentBox to match foundation requirements

This layout is plug and play but very simple, I'm working on it to add better contentBox integration 
so if you have some troubles, questions or optimisations to submit your welcome.
